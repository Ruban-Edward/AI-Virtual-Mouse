## AI-Virtual-Mouse
> Developed an AI-based approach for controlling the mouse movement using Python and openCV with real-time camera that detects hand landmarks, tracks gesture patterns instead of a physical mouse.

## Dependencies  -
> Please install all the required dependencies.
* openCV
* mediapipe
* autopy
* numpy

## Installation
<h3>Install Python</h3>

<h4>Install Python In your working System</h4>
Version Python 3.8.0

   ```bash
   https://www.python.org/downloads/
   ```
<h3>Python Libraries</h3>
<p>Open you COMMAND PROMPT in Administrator and Execute below commands</p>

<h4>1.  IMPORT CV2</h4>

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

<b>For image processing and drawing</b>
   OpenCV is a Python library that allows you to perform image processing and computer vision tasks.

<h4>2.  IMPORT NUMPY</h4>

   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```
   
   Numpy is an Array used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. NumPy arrays are faster and more compact than Python lists

<h4>3.  IMPORT AUTOPY</h4>

   ```bash
   pip install autopy
   ```
   
   <b>For controlling the mouse movement and click</b>
   AutoPy is a simple, cross-platform GUI automation toolkit for Python. It includes functions for controlling the keyboard and mouse

<h4>4.  IMPORT MEDIAPIPE</h4>

   ```bash
   pip install mediapipe
   ```
   
   <b>For Hand Tracking</b>
   Mediapipe is a cross-platform library developed by Google that provides amazing ready-to-use ML solutions for computer vision tasks. OpenCV library in python is a computer vision library that is widely used for image analysis, image processing, detection, recognition
